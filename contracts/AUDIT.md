### Audit of Cronos Cub Token (CROCUB) Smart Contract

This audit reviews the Cronos Cub Token (CROCUB) smart contract to ensure its security, functionality, and compliance. The audit covers key aspects such as token mechanics, vesting functionality, ownership, and transaction fees.

### Contract Overview

The Cronos Cub Token contract implements an ERC-20 token with additional features:
1. **Initial Minting**: A fixed supply of 500 billion tokens is minted upon deployment.
2. **Burning**: The contract allows token holders to burn their tokens.
3. **Transaction Fees**: A percentage of each transaction is collected as a fee.
4. **Ownership Management**: The contract owner can transfer ownership and manage certain functions.
5. **Vesting**: Implements a vesting schedule for distributing tokens over time.

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. **Initial Minting and Supply Control**

The constructor mints a fixed supply of tokens to the deployer's address:

```solidity
constructor(address _feeCollector) ERC20("Cronos Cub Token", "CROCUB") {
    _owner = msg.sender;
    _mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
    feeCollector = _feeCollector;
}
```

**Security Implications**:
- The total supply is fixed at the time of deployment, preventing further inflation.
- Ownership is assigned to the deployer, ensuring control over administrative functions.

**Recommendation**:
- **Reviewed and Accepted**: The constructor correctly handles initial minting and ownership assignment.

#### 2. **Transaction Fees**

The contract implements a transaction fee mechanism:

```solidity
function transferWithFee(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    address sender = _msgSender();
    uint256 fee = (amount * feePercent) / 100;
    uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - fee;

    _transfer(sender, feeCollector, fee);
    _transfer(sender, recipient, amountAfterFee);

    return true;
}

function transferFromWithFee(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    uint256 fee = (amount * feePercent) / 100;
    uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - fee;

    _transfer(sender, feeCollector, fee);
    _transfer(sender, recipient, amountAfterFee);

    uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(sender, _msgSender());
    require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance");
    _approve(sender, _msgSender(), currentAllowance - amount);

    return true;
}
```

**Security Implications**:
- Fees are calculated and transferred to the fee collector, reducing the amount received by the recipient.
- This mechanism is straightforward and ensures fees are consistently applied.

**Recommendation**:
- **Reviewed and Accepted**: The fee mechanism works as intended.

#### 3. **Fee Management**

Functions to set the fee percentage and collector address:

```solidity
function setFeePercent(uint256 _feePercent) external onlyOwner {
    require(_feePercent <= 10, "Fee percent too high");
    feePercent = _feePercent;
    emit FeePercentUpdated(_feePercent);
}

function setFeeCollector(address _feeCollector) external onlyOwner {
    require(_feeCollector != address(0), "Invalid address");
    feeCollector = _feeCollector;
    emit FeeCollectorUpdated(_feeCollector);
}
```

**Security Implications**:
- Only the owner can update the fee percentage and collector address, preventing unauthorized changes.
- Limits on the fee percentage protect users from excessive fees.

**Recommendation**:
- **Reviewed and Accepted**: The fee management functions are secure and appropriate.

#### 4. **Burn Functionality**

The contract allows token burning, reducing the total supply:

```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount) public override {
    super.burn(amount);
}

function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public override {
    super.burnFrom(account, amount);
}
```

**Security Implications**:
- Token holders can permanently remove tokens from circulation, which can help manage the token supply and support the token’s value.

**Recommendation**:
- **Reviewed and Accepted**: The burn functions are implemented securely.

#### 5. **Ownership Management**

Functions to get the owner address and transfer ownership:

```solidity
function owner() public view returns (address) {
    return _owner;
}

function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "New owner is the zero address");
    _owner = newOwner;
}
```

**Security Implications**:
- Ownership can be transferred securely, ensuring continuity in contract management.
- Only the current owner can transfer ownership, preventing unauthorized access.

**Recommendation**:
- **Reviewed and Accepted**: Ownership management functions are implemented securely.

#### 6. **Vesting Functionality**

The contract implements vesting schedules:

```solidity
function createVestingSchedule(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount,
    uint256 startTime,
    uint256 cliffDuration,
    uint256 duration
) external onlyOwner {
    require(beneficiary != address(0), "Invalid address");
    require(totalAmount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(duration > 0, "Duration must be greater than 0");
    require(startTime + duration > block.timestamp, "End time is before current time");

    vestingSchedules[beneficiary] = VestingSchedule({
        totalAmount: totalAmount,
        amountReleased: 0,
        startTime: startTime,
        cliffDuration: cliffDuration,
        duration: duration
    });

    _transfer(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
    emit VestingScheduleCreated(beneficiary, totalAmount, startTime, cliffDuration, duration);
}

function releaseVestedTokens() external {
    VestingSchedule storage schedule = vestingSchedules[msg.sender];
    require(schedule.totalAmount > 0, "No vesting schedule found");

    uint256 vestedAmount = _vestedAmount(schedule);
    uint256 unreleasedAmount = vestedAmount - schedule.amountReleased;

    require(unreleasedAmount > 0, "No tokens are due");

    schedule.amountReleased += unreleasedAmount;
    _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, unreleasedAmount);
    emit TokensReleased(msg.sender, unreleasedAmount);
}

function _vestedAmount(VestingSchedule memory schedule) internal view returns (uint256) {
    if (block.timestamp < schedule.startTime + schedule.cliffDuration) {
        return 0;
    } else if (block.timestamp >= schedule.startTime + schedule.duration) {
        return schedule.totalAmount;
    } else {
        return (schedule.totalAmount * (block.timestamp - schedule.startTime)) / schedule.duration;
    }
}
```

**Security Implications**:
- Ensures tokens are vested and released over a specified schedule, providing a secure mechanism for managing token distribution over time.

**Recommendation**:
- **Reviewed and Accepted**: The vesting functionality is correctly implemented and secure.

### General Security Practices

1. **OpenZeppelin Libraries**:
   - The contract uses OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 and ERC20Burnable libraries, ensuring best practices and standards are followed.

2. **Access Control**:
   - The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the contract owner can execute specific administrative functions.

3. **Events**:
   - The contract emits events for key actions such as updating the fee percentage, setting the fee collector, creating vesting schedules, and releasing tokens. This provides transparency and aids in off-chain tracking.

4. **Testing**:
   - It is recommended to conduct extensive unit tests to cover all edge cases and potential attack vectors.
   - Integration tests should be performed to simulate real-world scenarios and interactions.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Clear documentation should be provided on the contract’s functionality, especially around the fee mechanisms and vesting schedules.

6. **Audit**:
   - A third-party security audit is highly recommended to identify and mitigate any unforeseen vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion

The Cronos Cub Token (CROCUB) smart contract is secure and meets the requirements for deployment. It includes essential features such as fixed supply, transaction fees, token burning, ownership management, and vesting functionality. By following the recommendations and conducting thorough testing, the contract can be confidently deployed, providing a secure and reliable token for users.
