## ❌ Phase 1: Cub Birth

### ❌ Token launch on Cronos blockchain

#### Write the Token Contract ✅
Ensure the smart contract code for the Cronos Cub token is secure and ready for deployment. The contract should include initial minting, ownership, and burning functionalities as discussed.

The `$CROCUB` smart contract can be found here: https://github.com/Cronos-Cub/CROCUB/tree/main/contract

#### Audit the Contract ✅
Before deployment, get the smart contract audited by a reputable third-party security firm to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.

The `$CROCUB` smart contract audit can be found here: https://github.com/Cronos-Cub/CROCUB/blob/main/AUDIT.md

#### Compile and Deploy

Remix IDE, an Ethereum-compatible IDE, will be used to compile the `$CROCUB` smart contract.

#### Blockchain Explorer Verification

After deployment, the smart contract can be verified on Cronos Explorer, to help increase transparency and trust with the community.

#### Choose a DEX for IDO

Select a decentralized exchange (DEX) that supports the Cronos blockchain for the IDO. Possible options include VVS Finance or CronaSwap.
