# ü¶Å CronosCub ($CROCUB) Smart Contract ü¶Å

Welcome to the official repository for the CronosCub ($CROCUB) smart contract, a community-driven cryptocurrency project on the Cronos blockchain. This document provides an overview of the smart contract, including features, tokenomics, audit details, gas optimization techniques, and a deployment roadmap.

## Overview

CronosCub is a unique cryptocurrency project designed for and by the Crypto.com community. The project leverages the concept of dusting‚Äîdistributing small amounts of tokens to a wide range of wallet addresses‚Äîto engage users and promote adoption.

## Gas Optimization

The CronosCub smart contract is optimized for gas efficiency through:

- **Batch Operations**: Allows batch distribution of community tokens, reducing the number of transactions.
- **Minimized State Changes**: Efficient handling of state variables to minimize gas costs.
- **Efficient Data Types**: Uses appropriate data types to save gas.
- **Event Emission**: Utilizes events for transparency and efficient off-chain tracking without excessive on-chain data storage.

## Audit and Security

The CronosCub smart contract has undergone an internal audit, focusing on:

- **Re-entrancy Protection**: Ensuring no vulnerabilities exist for re-entrancy attacks.
- **Access Control**: Critical functions protected by `onlyOwner` modifier.
- **State Management**: Correct handling of state variables and updates.
- **Professional Audit Recommendation**: While the contract is deemed secure, a professional third-party audit is recommended for comprehensive security validation.

## Features and Functions

1. **ERC20 Compliance**: The contract follows the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with wallets and exchanges.
2. **Developer Vesting**: A scheduled vesting mechanism for developer tokens to align incentives with long-term project success.
3. **Community Token Distribution**: Functionality to distribute tokens to community members, supporting project engagement and growth, both manually and automatically.
