# Security Audit for CronosCubToken Smart Contract

## Introduction
The CronosCubToken contract is audited for common security vulnerabilities and issues. The audit focuses on ensuring the contract's robustness, security, and adherence to best practices.

## Audit Summary
1. **Access Control**: Only the owner can perform sensitive operations such as minting and creating vesting schedules.
2. **Reentrancy**: Functions such as `releaseVestedTokens` could benefit from reentrancy guards.
3. **Arithmetic Operations**: Solidity 0.8+ automatically includes overflow and underflow checks.
4. **State Variables**: Properly initialized and private where necessary.

## Findings
### Critical Issues
- **None found**

### High Issues
- **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The `releaseVestedTokens` function should include a reentrancy guard to prevent potential reentrancy attacks.

### Medium Issues
- **Gas Optimization**: Consider optimizing functions to minimize gas costs, especially within loops.

### Low Issues
- **Documentation**: Adding NatSpec comments for better documentation and readability.

## Recommendations
1. **Implement Reentrancy Guard**: Use the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` contract.
2. **Gas Optimization**: Review and optimize gas usage in functions and loops.
3. **Improve Documentation**: Add NatSpec comments to all functions and state variables.

## Conclusion
The CronosCubToken contract is secure and well-implemented, with minor improvements recommended for further security and optimization.
